Tutorial notebooks
==================

What is this?
-------------

-  This is an overview of tutorial `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`__
   notebooks for `Gammapy <http://gammapy.org>`__, a Python package for
   gamma-ray astronomy.
-  The notebooks complement the Gammapy Sphinx-based documentation at
   http://docs.gammapy.org
-  The notebooks and example datasets are available at
   https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra

Set up
------

The Gammapy installation instructions are here: :ref:`install`

One quick way to get set up, that works the same on Linux, Mac and Windows is this:

* Install Anaconda or Miniconda (see https://www.anaconda.com/download/ )
* Get the following repository that contains the Gammapy tutorial notebooks::

    git clone https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-extra.git
    export GAMMAPY_EXTRA=$PWD/gammapy-extra

* Create a Python conda environment that contains all software used in the tutorials::

    cd gammapy-extra
    conda env create -f environment.yml

* If you already have that environment, but want to update::

    conda env update -f environment.yml

* Activate the environment and start Jupyter::

    source activate gammapy-tutorial
    cd notebooks
    jupyter notebook

* Select and start the notebook you want in your webbrowser.

If you have any questions, ask for help. See http://gammapy.org/contact.html

Execute tutorials online
------------------------

If you want, you can execute latest version of the collection of notebooks on-line
accessing the `Gammapy Binder <http://mybinder.org/repo/gammapy/gammapy-extra>`__ space.

Click the "launch binder" link here, or at the top of each notebook below:

.. image:: http://mybinder.org/badge.svg
    :target: http://mybinder.org/repo/gammapy/gammapy-extra

Note that this is a free, temporary notebook server. You cannot upload your data or save
your work there. For that, install Gammapy on your machine and work there.

The basics
----------

Gammapy is a Python package built on Numpy and Astropy, and the
tutorials are Jupyter notebooks. If you're already familar with those,
you can skip to the next section and start learning about Gammapy.

To learn the basics, here are a few good resources.

Python
++++++

- `A Whirlwind tour of Python <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb>`__ (learn Python)

Scientific Python
+++++++++++++++++

- `Python data science handbook <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb>`__ (learn IPython, Numpy, matplotlib)

Astropy
+++++++

- `Astropy introduction for Gammapy users <notebooks/astropy_introduction.html>`__  | *astropy_introduction.ipynb*
- `Astropy Hands On (1st ASTERICS-OBELICS International School) <https://github.com/Asterics2020-Obelics/School2017/blob/master/astropy/astropy_hands_on.ipynb>`__
